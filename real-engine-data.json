      "canada": "Canada has reduced its permanent resident targets to 395,000 for 2025 (down from previous years), representing a strategic shift toward quality over quantity in immigration selection. The Express Entry system has pivoted to targeted, category-based draws focusing on French language proficiency, healthcare workers, STEM professionals, and trades. Provincial Nominee Programs face significant allocation cuts - BC reduced by 50% to 4,000 nominations, while other provinces adjust their selection criteria accordingly.",
      "uk": "Canada maintains competitive positioning against UK immigration pathways, with faster processing times for skilled workers and clearer pathways to permanent residence. While UK post-study work visas offer limited duration, Canada's system provides stronger permanent residency prospects for international graduates and skilled professionals seeking long-term settlement.",
      "europe": "European professionals increasingly view Canada as an attractive alternative, particularly in tech and healthcare sectors. Canada's bilingual advantage appeals to French-speaking Europeans, while the Start-up Visa program attracts European entrepreneurs. Processing times remain competitive compared to European internal mobility programs.",
      "southeast-asia": "Southeast Asian migration to Canada continues through family class immigration and skilled worker programs, though new caps on international students affect traditional pathways. The region remains a priority source for healthcare professionals and skilled trades workers under provincial nominee programs."
